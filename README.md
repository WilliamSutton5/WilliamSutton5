### 👨‍💻 About Me

I’m a data science student with a strong interest in applying analytics and machine learning to real-world problems — especially in sports, business, and product strategy.  
I enjoy building end-to-end projects that involve data collection, modeling, visualization, and deployment.

Right now, I’m especially focused on:
- NFL analytics and draft modeling  
- Machine learning and predictive modeling  
- Data visualization and storytelling  
- Systems engineering concepts (APIs, containers, cloud, pipelines)
